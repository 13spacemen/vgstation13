changes:
- imageadd: The old vaguely dandelion-looking weeds have had an art pass and now look
    slightly more like dandelions.
- rscadd: Added dandelion seeds to the MegaSeed Servitor's contraband products.
- rscadd: Dandelions may be harvested as soon as their yellow flowers have bloomed,
    but waiting further will allow the flowers to turn into pappus, which can be harvested
    themselves.
- rscadd: Dandelion flowers can be ground for their yellow dye, or turned into leafy
    incense by using it on an incense oil container.
- rscadd: Dandelion pappus can be used 3 times to spread their seeds onto nearby empty
    trays or soil.
- rscadd: Dandelions both in trays or harvested as pappus will spread their seeds
    when exposed to air currents.
- imageadd: Added in-hand icons for Dandelions, Sunflowers, Harebells, Novaflowers
    and Moonflowers.
- bugfix: Pre-mapped tower-cap logs can now be properly have their seeds extracted.
- bugfix: Flavor texts when plants mutate and whatnot should now properly account
    for the plant's designation being singular or plural.
- rscadd: Dandelions can be mutate into Dandelions(?) which re-use the old weeds sprites.
