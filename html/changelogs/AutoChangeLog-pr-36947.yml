changes:
- rscadd: Plants exposed to radiation now have a chance to mutate. Young plants planted
    in the past minute have a high chance of mutating, while older ones have a very
    small chance of a minor gene mutation (if all your trays in Hydroponics have plants
    and a radiation storm occurs, expect 3-5 of them to display a small mutation).
    Furthermore, closing the tray's lid completely removes any chance of radiation-induced
    mutations.
- tweak: If a plant mutates to different species, it will no longer have an additional
    small mutation applied at the same time.
