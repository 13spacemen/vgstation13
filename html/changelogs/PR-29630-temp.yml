  - rscadd: All condiment bottles can have their content spilled over the floor if they are set to transfer 10 or more units. The amount spilled depends of the transferable amount set.
  - rscadd: Spilling 10 or more units of black pepper over the floor will create a cleanable mess.
  - imageadd: Tweaked the icons for salt piles and pepper mills.
  - rscadd: "Added Holy Salts, a new reagent that can be easily produced by putting normal table salt in presence of a 5u catalyst of holy water. Just like salt, it will create cleanable piles when 10u of it are spilled over the floor."
  - rscadd: "When salt piles are spawned, they now emit particles when they detect the presence of cult runes (even if concealed), talismans, tomes, and most other cult paraphernelia. After a set amount of time, the runes will be destroyed, the talismans and tomes will burn, and the other objects will break and melt away. The delay is 5 minutes for regular table salt, and 20 seconds for holy salts and starts when the pile is created."
  - rscadd: "When a Path Entrance rune or a talisman attuned to a Path Exit rune is destroyed by a salt pile, a blood jaunt visible for a short duration will zoom toward the corresponding exit, giving the crew a hint as to the location of the Path Exit, and potentially a cult base. The jaunt will make a distinctive noise once it reaches the exit, letting any cultist near it at the time know that their base might be compromised."
