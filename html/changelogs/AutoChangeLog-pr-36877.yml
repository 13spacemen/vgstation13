changes:
- tweak: Slimes will now become ravenous in the presence of monkeys, causing them
    to become hungry and thus try to eat anything they can reach (including the monkeys),
    which also allows the slimes to feed far sooner on the monkeys than they otherwise
    would.
- tweak: Slimes can now store slightly more nutrition, meaning that they can develop
    into adult slimes and then split by eating two monkeys in a smaller form instead
    of having to eat a monkey in a smaller form and another monkey in a larger form.
