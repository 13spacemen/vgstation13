changes:
- bugfix: Fixed gases leaving hydro trays despite their lid being closed.
- bugfix: Fixed vines spawning outside hydro trays despite their lid being closed
    when they have just acquired the mutation.
- bugfix: Dead plants can no longer mutate further.
- bugfix: Fixed connected pipes not updating their atmosphere as they should when
    canisters and hydroponic trays connected to them change their content.
- tweak: You can now pour water and nutriments inside hydroponic trays even with their
    lid closed. The flavor text is slightly different to reflect you using its injection
    port. Likewise using a hoe or clippers on a tray now has flavor text specify that
    you use its access port.
