changes:
- tweak: Hydro Tray lights now update immediately after pouring a reagent into it
    (reagents still get processed by the tray over time, but the lights anticipate
    how much the reagents currently held will change the tray's variables)
- tweak: Paint reagents are now slightly toxic to hydroponics plants, except flax
    oil which is slightly nutritious.
- tweak: Water and Holy Water now hydrate trays just as much
- tweak: Toxins in hydro tray and soil now become progressively more visible as it
    builds up, instead of suddenly becoming visible past a threshold.
