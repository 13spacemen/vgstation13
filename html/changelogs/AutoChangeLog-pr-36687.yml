changes:
- tweak: Grues will now strip the flesh off of the bones of humans they kill instead
    of gibbing them, unless they are races with no blood such as plasmamen. They can
    chomp them again to gib them.
- tweak: Grues can no longer gain power from eating pure skeletons. Does not include
    plasmamen or liches.
