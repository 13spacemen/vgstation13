changes:
- bugfix: Timer and proximity sensor assemblies now accurately tick their timers down
    to the second instead of every two seconds, and timed from the moment they were
    activated. For consistency, all pre-spawned chem grenades now have their arm time
    doubled as to make them activate in the same amount of time as before this change.
- bugfix: Proximity sensors now count down to zero in the same manner as timers.
