changes:
- rscadd: Added Moody Lights to Hydroponic trays. This concerns not only their warning
    lights, but also the tray's own light toggle which lights up the plant quite nicely
    in the dark, and the plant's own bioluminescence. Plant may have custom moody
    light overlays, but ones that don't just glow all over if the bioluminescent gene
    is spliced into them.
- rscadd: Alt-Click on Hydroponic trays now brings up a radial menu to quickly toggle
    its light, its lid, or set its label.
- rscadd: Ctrl-Click (while anchored) lets you quickly toggle the lid, which was what
    Alt-Click previously did.
- rscadd: Hydroponic trays now react to EMPs, having a chance to turn off their light
    and toggle their lid.
- imageadd: Re-sprited the hydroponic tray lids. Added animations and sounds when
    you toggle them.
- imageadd: Hydroponic tray sprites have been tweaked to display whether their internal
    light is on or off.
- imageadd: The water level in hydroponic trays now visibly goes down.
- imageadd: Some large plants now have an alternative appearance when constrained
    by a closed lid.
- imageadd: If a plant exudes plasma or sleeping gas and its lid is closed, you can
    now see the gas through the lid.
- imageadd: Improved the way plants grow visually so that more of their sprited stages
    may appear over the course of their growth.
- imageadd: Hydroponic Trays now have a different sprite when they are un-anchored.
- imageadd: Hydroponic Trays now have a visible vent when wrenched on top of a connector.
- bugfix: Fixed some more the way Hydroponic Trays transfer gas when connected to
    a pipenet, or when their lid is open in general. You may now even use them as
    slow, one-way, passive vents.
- tweak: Newly built hydroponic trays now require you to fill them with water.
- rscadd: You can now build plastic hydroponic trays! Easy to build, but just like
    with soil it won't provide you with any of the sensor data.
