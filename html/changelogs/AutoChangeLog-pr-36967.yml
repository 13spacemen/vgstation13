changes:
- tweak: Apiaries no longer require you to build them into an hydroponics tray! Just
    click an adjacent floor while holding the kit.
- imageadd: Apiaries have new sprites to commemorate their graduation from being tray-bound.
- imageadd: Apiary kits now have in-hand icons.
- tweak: You no longer need a hatchet to harvest an apiary and can now do so bare-handed.
    Doing it this way no longer deconstructs the apiary so you can just calm the bees
    and let them return to it on their own. Hatchets (or alternatively crowbars) are
    still required to deconstruct them, which still also harvests them at the same
    time if they contain honey.
- soundadd: Added sounds for building/deconstructing apiaries, and for pouring BeezEz
    in them.
- rscadd: Apiaries and hives can burn down at long last.
