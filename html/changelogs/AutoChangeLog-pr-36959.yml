changes:
- rscadd: Metastable Mutagen, a chem that selectively mutates the chemicals on plants,
    letting you semi-reliably remove (and add) chems via mutations. Made with equal
    parts Unstable Mutagen and Charcoal, with 5u Enzyme as a catalyst.
- rscadd: Metatable Mutagen, a sibling to Metastable Mutagen that does the same, but
    it will also randomly transform into any of the other tables in the game if sprayed
    onto them. Made with equal parts Untable Mutagen (the botany version) and Charcoal,
    with 5u Enzyme as a catalyst.
