changes:
- tweak: Self heating cup ramen now only requires the container for the reaction,
    and does not use calcium oxide within, now only requiring 10u of water to heat
    and not 12.
- spellcheck: The millilitres on cup ramen's description have been changed to reference
    units, for consistency.
