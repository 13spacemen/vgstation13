changes:
- bugfix: The "you cannot add that component!" error no longer shows up on stacks
    being added to machine frames if they're the right type.
- tweak: The parts to use list only gets updated and shown to the user on a successful
    change.
- tweak: Stacks can now be used on machine frames if under the required amount, although
    it will only reduce the requirement by that amount.
