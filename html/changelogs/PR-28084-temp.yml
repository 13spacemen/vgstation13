changes:
  - rscadd: "Soulstoning someone with a soul gem instead of a soul stone shard will spawn a coffer containing their belongings, their skull, and a glass of their blood like failed conversions currently do (but not for long, conversion overhaul coming very soon)"
  - rscadd: "Committing suicide while holding a soul stone, soul gem, or soul blade that don't already contain a shade will let you capture yourself. Most useful when done with a soul blade obviously. Using a soul blade this way will set its blood count to 50 if it was any lower."
  - tweak: Pale Bodies now drop all their items upon death instead of them being destroyed when they dust.
  - tweak: "Shades have had their HP raised back to their original value, from 40 to 50 (It was lowered in 2018 on the day after Cult 3.0 released because apparently people thought they were too strong somehow?)"
  - tweak: "Shades and Constructs can now understand galactic common, and speak it with :1. This includes chaos blades. Non-cult constructs on the other hand can speak in cult chants if they so desire using :5."
  - tweak: Edited the name and description of a few Artificer spells for consistency and clarity.
  - bugfix: Fixed various cult and antag items being freely scannable by mechanics.
  - bugfix: Fixed a few instances where soul stones or blade could capture a sacrifice target (not counting using an empty soul blade for the sacrifice)
  - bugfix: Potentially fixed remaining instances of shades in soul blades not properly getting their UI
