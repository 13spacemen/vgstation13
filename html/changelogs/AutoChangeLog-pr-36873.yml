- rscadd: Methamphetamine can be made stationside by enterprising chemists. Slower
    and way more expensive to make but overall better than hyperzine, and performance
    enhancing, too. It does make you tweak out at times, though. Made by mixing 1
    part Albuterol, 3 parts Hydrogen, 1 part Chlorine and 5u Carbon (catalyst), then
    heating to 200Â°C, which makes 2 parts meth.
