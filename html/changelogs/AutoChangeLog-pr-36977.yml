changes:
- bugfix: Fixed christmas lights now actually emitting any light. Their lit up sprite
    also now appears over darkness.
- bugfix: Fixed snow tiles not regenerating snow like they should sometimes.
- bugfix: Fixed each snow tile and christmas light having a duplicate on top of them.
- tweak: Reworked the way snow tiles hold snow so instead of losing snow from the
    duplicate tile you get even more! Each tile now has 10 snow which it regenerates
    by one every 30 seconds. You can grab 1 snow by hand, or 3 at a time by shovel.
    If the tile reaches 0 snow it disappears.
- imageadd: Re-added the grabbed and digged snow tile sprites so you can easily see
    whether a tile is full of snow, or whether it's one shovel hit away from disappearing.
