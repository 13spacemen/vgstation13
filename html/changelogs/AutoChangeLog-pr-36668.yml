changes:
- bugfix: Coinboxes can now come out of vending machines again.
- tweak: Coinboxes and vendpacks now eject from crowbar destroying vending machines.
    Vendpacks still require inserted cardboard for this.
- tweak: Coinboxes can now be recycled for metal, under the electronics category.
- tweak: To compensate coinboxes being recyclable, and as to not be an infinite metal
    source, they are now required in their frame build step. A no access requirement
    version of them can be built as a metal stack recipe to aid this.
