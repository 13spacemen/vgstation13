changes:
- bugfix: Putting non sliceable objects on a plate and cutting them no longer leaves
    behind a non-plated pseudo duplication of the food within, instead, any items
    placed inside the food on a plate is moved out.
- bugfix: Sliceable objects can now be sliced when put on a plate, leaving the plate
    behind.
