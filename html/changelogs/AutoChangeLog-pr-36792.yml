- rscadd: Wizards can upgrade the Pitbull spell to summon Toadline Pitbulls for 20
    spell points. Toadline Pitbulls move slightly slower than a regular pitbull, but
    have the advantage of being able to pass through airlocks and other mobs unimpeded
    (the airlock pass is NOT instantaneous, it takes a bit). They also do 1 more Brute
    damage on average compared to a regular Pitbull.
