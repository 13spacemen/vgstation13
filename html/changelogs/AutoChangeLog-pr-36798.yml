- bugfix: Removed unused code which concerned attacking with slimes in order to cause
    brain damage, which was unused for a variety of reasons including; regular slimes
    cannot be picked up, the code only works with items, and it only worked against
    non-carbon mobs which, as far as I know, are not affected by brain damage.
