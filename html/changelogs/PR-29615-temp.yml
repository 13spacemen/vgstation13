changes:
  - experiment: "Added a new Traitor Botanist uplink item, the Bee-Nade, which has been reworked to in fact spawn hornets that will immediately seek a target when they spawn. They also ignore the one who primed the spawner grenade, just like viscerators do. Cost 16 (Discount 8)"
  - experiment: "The Hornet Queen Packet traitor item has been replaced with a Deployable Wild Hornet Hive. Place it, throw it, drop it, but be careful as it cannot be picked up again once deployed. Those behave exactly like those from random events, except they spawn with less hornets inside, giving you a few seconds to get away before they start coming out. Cost 10 (Discount 5)"
  - experiment: "The swarm coming out of a Bee Briefcase now performs an attack as soon as it comes out of the briefcase, greatly increasing its lethal power. The TC cost has been slightly adjusted to match its increased lethality. Cost 12 (Discout 6)"
  - experiment: "Bees and the likes now attack AFTER moving instead of before. This effectively increases their attack range, and so their dangerousness."
  - tweak: Bees that spawn from vermin infestations and hornets of all kind now immediately become angry again after their calmed status has expired instead of going back to their hive or to roaming.
  - rscadd: "Bee and Hornet gatling guns bullets no longer deal direct damage, instead they immediately cause the spawned bug to attack once on impact. Said attack is also guaranteed to pierce bio or impermeable armors."
  - rscadd: "Added a chillbug gatling gun. It doesn't deal damage of course but will inject 1u chillwax into players hit by the projectile."
  - rscadd: Added both the hornetgun and chillgun to Summon Guns.
  - bugfix: Bees and the likes can no longer attack through one-sided windows and windoors.
  - bugfix: Fixed not being able to stomp snails when on harm intent.
