- rscadd: A new reagent "killer pheromones" can be harvested from killer tomato plants
    and killer tomato meat. When consumed, this makes all mobs that can become hostile
    from attacks go after the player in a radius based on amount consumed. All mobs
    made hostile from this method then become calm towards the player again when the
    reagent is removed from their system.
