changes:
- bugfix: Fixed Hologram Projectors nullspacing items worn or held by holograms when
    they die.
- bugfix: Fixed Hologram Projector player transitions between pAI and Hologram (quickly
    swapping from one to the other should no longer cause any issues)
- bugfix: Fixed the Hologram Projector's ray not properly tracking the hologram or
    its projector in most cases.
- rscadd: pAI slotted inside a Hologram Projector can now re-spawn their hologram
    if it disappeared without requiring outside help, using a new button under the
    pAI Commands tab.
