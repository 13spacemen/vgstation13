changes:
- rscadd: Recycling furnaces can now have credits claimed from them for recycling,
    albeit meager amounts in the majority of cases, and with the tradeoff of deducting
    from materials smeltable for value claimed.
- rscadd: Smelter consoles can now be ID locked or unlocked to prevent claiming of
    credits. Recycling ones start unlocked by default, mining ones default to mining
    access. Emagging also removes all access locks.
