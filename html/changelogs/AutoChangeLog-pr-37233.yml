- rscadd: Advanced RCDs now have a new schematic that lets them turn reinforced windows
    into their plasma varieties for 5 matter units each, if a dark purple slime extract
    is applied. This will only affect the first full window and first normal window
    of each rotated direction on the tile, so building multiple on one tile and converting
    them all won't work.
