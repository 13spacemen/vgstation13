changes:
- bugfix: Fixed a year-old bug where the Staff of Swip-Swap couldn't be wielded. Now
    it can be wielded to empower the projectile, which allows it to go through windows.
- bugfix: (Admins) Changing the "detachable_cell" variable for energy weapons will
    now also handle whether it will give the gun the respective "Detach Cell" verb
    or not.
