- tweak: The following changes have been done to the Rampant Brand Intelligence event.
    The original infected vending machine is now guaranteed to emit one of its custom
    slogans when it infects another vending machine, making players more likely to
    find it (and to hear those slogans at all like jesus christ the odds were ridiculously
    low). When the event ends, ALL infected machines stop throwing items instead of
    only 90 percent, and their speakers now return to their previous value instead
    of always being deactivated.
