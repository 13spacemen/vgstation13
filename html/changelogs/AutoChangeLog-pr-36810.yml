- bugfix: Fixed a 7-year-old bug where non-sharp items with enough force did not have
    any chance of ripping off a limb as opposed to turning it into gibs. The check
    has now been fixed and now strong blunt melee weapons have a chance to rip off
    a broken limb instead of gibbing a broken limb.
