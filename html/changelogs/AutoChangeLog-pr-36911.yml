changes:
- rscadd: You can now buy semi-randomized small town brewery beer kegs in cargo for
    60 credits, these are safe.
- rscadd: Hacking the cargo console lets you buy the off-brand beer kegs for 40 credits,
    which can contain dangerous chemicals, but also extra special chems.
- rscadd: These beer kegs will be VERY contaminated (at least 1 dangerous chemical
    on average) if the station is on the DOES NOT TIP backdoor.
- bugfix: Adds Iced Beer to the COLDDRINKS define (i had forgotten iced beer was a
    thing).
- tweak: The Does Not Tip backdoor uplink description also mentions it poisoning beers.
