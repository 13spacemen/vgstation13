changes:
- tweak: The Floral Somatoray has been refactored and should now behave more as you
    might expect. You can use it on trays both at range and adjacently, although if
    someone is standing in-between they might get hit instead.
- rscadd: You can once again change the brute damage of bees by using the Floral Somatoray
    on apiaries while it's set to Morphology, while Development controls the yield.
    There are plans to allow further genetic alterations of bees in the future.
- rscadd: You can now use a solder to "un-emag" a floral somatoray.
- imageadd: The Floral Somatoray has had a sprite pass with its appearance depending
    on its currently selected mode. The rays it fire also change color based on the
    selected mode.
- soundadd: The Floral Somatoray makes a new sound when charging and firing at stuff.
