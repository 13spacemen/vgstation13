changes:
- bugfix: Martians will now properly block projectile effects using their shields.
- bugfix: Fixed a few instances in the code where having full protection against a
    projectile attack would still cause projectile effects to happen, even when it
    should be completely blocked.
- bugfix: Fixed a 5-year-old bug where silicons were unintentionally subjected to
    various projectile effects such as syringes from syringe guns. However, they have
    retained their weakness to slowdown caused by tasers.
- bugfix: Force Wall will now only pick one character on its turf to deal damage to
    if it is impacted by a projectile, as opposed to affecting every single character,
    and will now respect whether the user could block the attack or not.
