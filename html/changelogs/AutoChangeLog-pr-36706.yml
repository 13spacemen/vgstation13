changes:
- bugfix: Mindless cyborgs, AIs and MoMMIs can now be properly transformed.
- bugfix: Fixed a bug where a piece of code responsible for generalized damaged dealing
    could, in some cases (mostly regarding species resistances and weaknesses to damage
    types) do far more damage than intended.
- tweak: Internal wounds will no longer be considered sources of damage to determine
    limb damage.
- experiment: Attempted a fix where humans transformed into other humans through means
    such as the Staff of Change will now properly transfer their damage over instead
    of being completely healed.
