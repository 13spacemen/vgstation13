changes:
  - rscadd: "Snow Station Security Station has been totally refurbished. Most rooms have extra tiles to work with and a layout that looks less like a tornado went through. If there is ANY issue on the Security Station, forward it please. Tis not too late"
  - rscadd: "Snaxi Bridge now has all the computers it should have and looks a LOT better, with a window bay that's now secured. Captain's Office has been fixed up to not be so stacked up. Vault now has extra goodies locked away"
  - rscadd: Snaxi Chapel has been improved a bit. The maint access that went outside has been moved above it instead of below to make place for some hallway and Bridge extensions
  - rscadd: "Snaxi Security Department has been improved a lot bit. More windows so you can actually see around (especially important sightlines like HoS to Armory and Warden to Brig Cells). Armory is bigger and now has a LOT more stock and should be equivalent to Boxstation (unique gear like segways, combat shotties and the mosin nagants were preserved)"
  - rscadd: "Snaxi Arrivals and Escape has gotten a massive decoration budget and layout improvement and the security checkpoint gimmick that literally no-one used ever has been nuked. Equally, the actual Escape bay now looks more like the other maps instead of being tight and dark"
  - rscadd: Snaxi Mining and Xenoarch Bay now looks less dumb and the layout has been improved
  - rscadd: Some minor improvements to other things like the parkings (now fancier and extra spot). Other station reworks pending
