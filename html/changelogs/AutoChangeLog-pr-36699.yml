- rscadd: Improved the Absorb spell that Civil War of Casters wizards and Summon Magic
    survivors get; every spell that the absorber and the absorbed share will upgrade
    the absorber's respective spell, it now displays a message as to whether the target
    has any spells that could be stolen, and it will no longer attempt to absorb non-wizardly
    spells.
