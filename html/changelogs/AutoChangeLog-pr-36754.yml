- rscadd: Squash plants! Mutate a pumpkin to get your very own squash. They are not
    as efficient at making nutriment, but are filled with precious Squash (reagent).
- rscadd: The Squash reagent/drug is a double edged performance enhancer that boosts
    your tackling abilities. If consumed by non dwarves, they'll suffer brute damage
    for 30s before turning into a dwarf (as long as Squash is still in their system).
    If they run out of squash, the recoil from growing back to normal size will break
    every bone in their body, unless their bones were reinforced with Degencalcium
    beforehand.
- rscadd: The Squash drug can be manufactured by mixing equal parts Manly Dorf, Degenerate
    Calcium and Hyperzine.
