changes:
- rscadd: The laser pistol and laser rifle from R&D now have extremely poor accuracy
    during April Fools.
- rscadd: Added a few variables that admins might find useful, related to ranged weapon
    accuracy.
- bugfix: Fixed an at least 4 years old bug where lasers did not say what living entity
    they've hit.
- bugfix: (ApotheoticOrder provided the fix) Fixed the Lightning effects such as from
    the wizard's spell or the traitor's power gloves, the sprites will now properly
    show up. There is still a bug where the visuals do not line up in some circumstances
    with the target but it is a vast improvement over nothing.
- bugfix: The Lightning wizard spell will now properly target bots and mechas.
- bugfix: Wizards can no longer cast Lightning on themselves, which didn't do anything
    because they are immune to their own Lightning.
- bugfix: Fixed an exploit where a gun could have unlimited damage by repeatedly attempting
    to perform point-blank shots with a ballistic weapon while not actually being
    able to fire the gun, such as through wearing boxing gloves, and then firing the
    weapon.
- tweak: Hitting a missing limb with a projectile will no longer hit the target, but
    instead display a missing message and what limb is missing.
- tweak: Improved the Stormtrooper Blaster Rifle's ability to miss its targets.
- tweak: The EMP effect from the Lightning spell is now more severe.
- tweak: The Lightning spell will no longer cause blurriness and stuttering.
- tweak: The Lightning spell will no longer chain arc to other targets if it hits
    something that isn't a valid target. That means no random lightning through walls!
- tweak: Point blank shots now have an accuracy boost, such that under normal conditions
    they should never miss.
