changes:
- rscadd: Chocolate cows can be purchased from cargo for 45c, and can be milked for
    delicious chocolate milk.
- rscadd: Chocolate milk, made the same way as Hot Coco is (5 parts milk 1 part coco)
    but without heating, and requires a starter sample of chocolate milk as a catalyst.
    Alternatively, can be milked from the aforementioned cows.
- tweak: Chocolate milk can be turned into hot coco by heating it to 60Â°C.
