changes:
- tweak: A neo-ultra-capitalism mode Old Vendotron will no longer kill itself by summoning
    a lot of hostile creatures that it would proceed to go to combat with, and now
    the creatures it creates become part of the same faction as it.
- bugfix: Fixed the Old Vendotron's plate attack so that it will no longer throw plates
    on its own tile. It will now properly throw them away.
