changes:
  - bugfix: "wounds on non-humans no longer look much darker than they should, now appropriately matching their blood color. Burn wounds also now look the same for all species."
  - imageadd: "Vox husk overlay is now blue, Plasmaman husk overlay is now purple."
  - tweak: "Plasmamen now have proper species data for their flesh and blood. Even if they don't have any blood, their gibs splatters and footprints will now be purple."
  - bugfix: Blood splattered by extracted organs now properly matches the color of the blood of the species it was harvested from (and also carries their viruses)
  - bugfix: The kitchen gibber (and autogibber) now properly produce gibs matching the color of the flesh and blood of the species that was gibbed.
  - rscadd: Monkeys and adult Xenomorphs can now be thrown inside the kitchen gibber as well.
  - rscadd: Standing in front of the gibber when it gibs will also splatter you and your held items with blood. Standing next to gibbing mobs will now have the same effect. nasty!
  - tweak: the autogibber now only spawns a brain if the gibbed mob had a client.
  - bugfix: "skellingtons, golems, lich and other non-meat producing species no longer get jammed stuck inside the autogibber."
  - rscadd: "You can now directly splash items with blood to bloody them, rather than having to pick them up with bloody hands."
  - bugfix: "Fixed many bugs related to blood about how it wouldn't properly carry DNA, color, etc, if its donor's body was deleted."
  - bugfix: "Fixed shoes not properly appearing smudged in oil, vomit, old blood, etc, if the player hasn't previously walked on a splatter that contains some actual DNA. All splatters now have some actual info, that will also show up when scanned by the detective's scanner."
  - imageadd: "The janitor's mop now updates its appearance depending on what reagents it is soaked in."
  - imageadd: "The janitor's mop bucket now has a slightly different sprite when deployed."
  - tweak: Wearing a bucket filled with reagents now immediately empties its content over you instead of after a delay.
delete-after: true
