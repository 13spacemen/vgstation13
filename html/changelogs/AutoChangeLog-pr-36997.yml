changes:
- bugfix: Players can now actually disallow item use when targeting with guns. As
    described, this will not count for turf or HUD clicks.
- bugfix: Moving in a vehicle now counts as moving when targeted with a gun.
- tweak: The message the player receives on being targeted now more helpfully tells
    them which restrictions are or are not in place.
