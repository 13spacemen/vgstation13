changes:
- bugfix: The mode change buttons on assemblies now properly refresh them.
- tweak: Assembly windows now refresh as the timers tick down, instead of manually
    with the refresh button.
- tweak: Unnecessary close and refresh buttons have now been removed from the UIs
    of timers, proximity sensors, infrared sensors and light tile remotes as these
    functions happen normally now.
