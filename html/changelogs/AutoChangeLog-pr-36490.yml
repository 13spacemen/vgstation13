changes:
- rscadd: Expands the braindamage speech, adding a good amount of extra words and
    syllables that will be replaced with their dumb counterpart. Braindamaged players
    might also find themselves forgetting a word once in a while.
- rscadd: Braindamaged players might find themselves gibbering incoherently if they
    try to speak too fast.
- tweak: Reduces the forced screaming chance and forced stutter chance when talking
    while braindamaged by 15 and 5 percent respectively, since those values felt better
    with this change.
