changes:
- rscadd: Chaplains who adhere to the Belmont religion now spawn with a box containing
    clothing reminiscent of Richter Belmont, and a flask of Sacred Water in their
    pocket. They can also throw their bible to hit people around them with it.
- rscadd: Sacred Water is a new reagent that turns Holy Water into more of itself
    when in contact with it. When splashed on a floor, it creates sacred flames that
    only burn the unholy (that is, vampires, cultists, and any other supernatural
    creature)
- rscadd: Players may now forge a Battle Cross out of silver at an anvil. Battle Crosses
    are basically boomerangs that deal bonus damage to supernatural creatures, but
    they only return to the hands of those of the Belmont religion.
- experiment: Boomerangs have been rewritten from scratch and now behave more like
    you would expect from a boomerang in a video game. They are now a lot more reliable
    so their damage has been lowered from 16 to 10, but they still feel really strong
    so I'm looking forward to feedback by players who have been on both ends of a
    boomerang throw.
- imageadd: Boomerangs have also gotten a re-sprite.
- imageadd: Attacking supernatural creatures with holy weapons now displays a visual
    effect.
- imageadd: Kamina and Simon's glasses have gotten some visual adjustments on top
    of proper object icons. Furthermore, you can now unleash their power by using
    them in your hand and throwing them.
- bugfix: Fixed the wrong icon appearing for some bibles in the religion picker interface.
